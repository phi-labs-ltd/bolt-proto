# Message Flow in Bolt Protocol

This document explains how messages flow through the Bolt Protocol system, showing how different components interact to enable zero-slippage trading, on-demand liquidity, and cross-chain compatibility.

## Oracle Service Flow

The Oracle Service provides price feed data to the Bolt Protocol. Here's how information flows through this service:

```mermaid

    participant PF as Price Feeder
    participant OS as Oracle Service
    participant BC as Blockchain (Smart Contracts)
    participant LP as Liquidity Providers
    participant Trader

    PF->>OS: PostPricesRequest
    Note over PF,OS: Submits current market prices
    OS->>BC: Store Price Data
    Note over OS,BC: Prices recorded on-chain
    
    Trader->>BC: Request Trade
    BC->>OS: Query Latest Prices
    OS->>BC: Return Price Data
    
    BC->>LP: Request Liquidity
    Note over BC,LP: Based on accurate pricing
    LP->>BC: Provide Liquidity
    BC->>Trader: Execute Trade
    Note over BC,Trader: Zero-slippage execution
```

### Step-by-Step Explanation

1. **Price Data Collection**:
   - External price feeders collect market data from various sources
   - Price data is aggregated and formatted into `PriceUpdate` messages
   - A `PostPricesRequest` containing multiple `PriceUpdate` messages is sent to the Oracle Service

2. **Price Data Storage**:
   - The Oracle Service validates incoming price data
   - Valid price data is stored in the blockchain's state
   - This creates a reliable, tamper-proof record of price information

3. **Trade Execution**:
   - When a trader initiates a trade, the smart contract queries the latest price data
   - The Oracle Service returns the current price information
   - The smart contract uses this data to determine the fair execution price

4. **Liquidity Provision**:
   - Based on accurate pricing, the protocol requests liquidity from providers
   - Liquidity providers offer assets at the oracle-provided price
   - The trade executes with zero slippage, as price is determined before liquidity is committed

## Cross-Chain Operations

For cross-chain operations, the protocol extends this flow with bridge components:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ChainA as Blockchain A
    participant Bridge
    participant OracleA as Oracle Service (Chain A)
    participant OracleB as Oracle Service (Chain B)
    participant ChainB as Blockchain B

    User->>ChainA: Initiate Cross-Chain Transaction
    ChainA->>OracleA: Get Source Chain Price
    OracleA->>ChainA: Return Price Data
    
    ChainA->>Bridge: Send Transaction Data
    Bridge->>OracleB: Verify Destination Chain Price
    OracleB->>Bridge: Return Price Data
    
    Bridge->>ChainB: Execute on Destination Chain
    ChainB->>User: Confirm Transaction
```

### Cross-Chain Considerations

1. **Price Consistency**:
   - Oracle Services on different chains must maintain consistent pricing
   - The `InfoResponse` message helps identify which chain an Oracle is serving

2. **Bridge Security**:
   - Cross-chain messages must be securely verified before execution
   - Oracle data is used to ensure fair pricing across chains

3. **Latency Management**:
   - Cross-chain operations involve inherent latency
   - Oracle price validity periods must account for this latency

## On-Demand Liquidity Flow

The protocol enables on-demand liquidity through a combination of oracle pricing and liquidity provider incentives:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Trader
    participant Protocol
    participant Oracle
    participant LP as Liquidity Pool
    participant Providers

    Trader->>Protocol: Request Trade
    Protocol->>Oracle: Get Current Price
    Oracle->>Protocol: Return Price
    
    Protocol->>LP: Check Available Liquidity
    alt Sufficient Liquidity
        LP->>Protocol: Confirm Liquidity
    else Insufficient Liquidity
        Protocol->>Providers: Broadcast Liquidity Request
        Note over Protocol,Providers: With incentives based on oracle price
        Providers->>LP: Provide On-Demand Liquidity
        LP->>Protocol: Confirm Liquidity
    end
    
    Protocol->>Trader: Execute Trade at Oracle Price
    Note over Protocol,Trader: Zero slippage guaranteed
```

### On-Demand Liquidity Mechanism

1. **Liquidity Assessment**:
   - When a trade is requested, the protocol checks available liquidity
   - Oracle price data determines the execution price

2. **Liquidity Incentivization**:
   - If liquidity is insufficient, the protocol broadcasts a request to providers
   - Incentives are calculated based on oracle prices
   - Liquidity providers respond to these incentives by adding funds to the pool

3. **Guaranteed Execution**:
   - The trade executes at the oracle-provided price
   - This ensures zero slippage regardless of the liquidity depth

## Summary

The Bolt Protocol relies on accurate and timely price data from the Oracle Service to enable:

1. **Zero Slippage**: By establishing prices before liquidity commitment
2. **On-Demand Liquidity**: By incentivizing liquidity provision based on reliable pricing
3. **Cross-Chain Compatibility**: By maintaining consistent pricing across different blockchains

This message flow architecture ensures that all components work together to provide a seamless trading experience with Bolt's unique features.
